# 1-million-LOC
Many software and game engines contain 1 million+ loc. I'm skeptical of whether those lines even have real value. 
So I am creating a love community mmo project for that purpose. We will try to get 1 million lines of code then once we do,
we will look and see if every line is even needed (Probably not). The mmo will be perferably a space game that will be the 
game to represent love to the world. It should feature lua scripting in some way. 

Also the game will use https://love2d.org/wiki/LPC_License as the License meaning the project will be of the community. 
The game design is purposefully left extremely open so that everyone can have something to contribute. The game will have no set
story. That means hopefully the community can just add whatever they see fit to the game.
